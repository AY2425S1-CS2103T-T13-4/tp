### Project: CareLink

CareLink is a desktop address book application targeted towards independent Geriatricians managing elderly patients with chronic conditions, someone who can type fast, prefers CLI over GUI, and often needs to manage several patients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find a patient or caregiver based on the given NRIC [\#71]
  * What it does: allows the user to find 1 or more person by using their NRIC.
  * Justification: This feature enables the doctor to quickly retrieve the records of a patient using their NRIC. 
  * Highlights: This is an enhancement to the already existing find feature which finds person based on their names. This addition features quicker retrieval by using a person's unique NRIC.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the Parser to incorporate a new NRIC field [\#62]


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the FindNric feature
<!--
* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
